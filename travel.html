            <h3>Geographical Location: North America</h3>
            <p>Yellowstone is the first national park in the United States. It covers over 2.2 million acres, and provides an opportunity to see wildlife and explore geothermal areas.  In fact, Yellowstone contains about half the world's active geysers.</p>
            <p>These unique opportunities also bring out a lot of bad decisions among the tourists.  Every year visitors injure themselves or the wildlife by getting close to the animals.  You  can see examples of people making bad decisions by visiting <a href ="https://www.facebook.com/groups/yellowstonenationalparkinvasionoftheidiots/">Yellowstone National Park: Invasion of the Idiots</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/touronsofyellowstone/?hl=en">Tourons of Yellowstone</a>, or  <a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/">Cowboy State Daily</a>.</p>

            <h3>Geographical Location: Europe</h3>
            <p>Rome is one of the oldest metropolitan areas in the world. With a history dating back to 700 BC with the birth of the Roman Empire, the city has maintained its status as a cultural and historical hub of Europe. The city is peppered with ancient monuments, statues, and piazzas from different eras of history. The most famous location, the Colosseum, is touted as one of the seven modern wonders of the world. Rome houses several world famous museums, such as the Borghese and the Vatican Museum. It is also the only city in the world to encompass a recognized country, Vatican City.</p>
            <p>Rome is also a great location for food, wine, and leisure. At the heart of Italy, Rome is a central gathering place for a diverse array of Italian cuisine; Neapolitan Pizza from the south, Tuscan wine, and truffle from the north. The most famous dish of Rome is carbonara. Beyond the food, Rome has a vibrant nightlife. The Trastevere neighborhood has plenty of bars and clubs for patrons and, just over the river, the Centro shopping district is always bustling.</p>

            <p>Boulder, Colorado is where the Buffalo Roam. It is home to my Alma Mater, the University of Colorado! There are plenty of activities you can do outside in Boulder, they have several rivers to kayak on, and many hiking trails near the city center, most notably Chautauqua Park. Outdoor activities do not stop in the winter! That is when ski season starts and visitors from all over take to the slopes. The city is located just outside of Denver, the capital of Colorado. This makes commuting to and from Boulder quite easy. </p>
